* ft_containers
Boring, but once you finish this you do learn a lot from it, and get a deep understanding of how arrays work in C++ (vectors/stack/map). At the time of writing it is now deprecated though, and turned into CPP09.

* Inception
A very useful project, as you get to learn about Docker. Docker is used in real-world applications. Also teaches you about setting up a server. Although we did it in born2BeRoot, this project really reinforces how a server works as you would need to setup NGINX configs and IP networks.

* webserv
Unlike inception, you are the server yourself! No NGINX, no wordpress. Just your own server, made using C. Inception teaches you how to make server work, webserv teaches you how servers work.
